Oh no... we are too late... we must rebuild... we must remake...
We are the makers...
We are the dreamers...
We are the music...
We are the dreams...
We must clear away these dessicated remains...
We must remake this world in our own image...
We must send these remains to our museum...
We must first believe in the future in order to make it...
